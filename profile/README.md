# Astro Scripts and Science 
A place for Astronomers at Durham to share coding and science questions.  We have two groups within this workspace, which meet on alternating weeks on Tuesdays at 2pm.  **Code & Cuppa** covers the coding side of astronomy, and at **Scraps of Science** you can share all your science questions.  For more information see below.

## Code & Cuppa

A place for Astronomers at Durham University to discuss and learn about coding, and enjoy hot beverages.  Whether you have decades of coding experience or have just started coding for astronomy, you'll find a supportive environment to enhance your skills.

### What we do
- **Meet** once a fortnight
- **Bug fixing:** Bring our coding problems to collaboratively solve issues and debug projects
- **Learn new skills:** tutorials by members
- **Drink hot drinks**

### Who can join
Everyone within Astronomy at Durham University is welcome, regardless of skill level.  Bring your favourite hot drink, the bugs you've been struggling with, and join us for a cozy coding session.

### Meeting details
We meet once a fortnight both in-person and on Zoom.  Check the emails and slack for the next session.

## Scraps of Science




## Ground Rules
1. No-one's code is perfect (so don't worry about sharing your imperfect code!)
2. Provide constructive criticism (not just criticism)
3. Don't toolshame (try to provide suggestions using the current tools, not a completely different way of doing things)
4. Bring specific problems (so we don't have to look through 1000 lines of your code)


See you there!
The Code & Cuppa Team
