# Astro Scripts and Science 
A place for Astronomers at Durham to share coding and science questions.  We have two groups within this workspace, which meet on alternating weeks on Tuesdays at 2pm.  **Code & Cuppa** covers the coding side of astronomy, and at **Scraps of Science** you can share all your science questions.  For more information see below.

If you would like access to the workspace, please let one of the Code & Cuppa organisers know.

## :computer: Code & Cuppa :coffee:

A place for Astronomers at Durham University to discuss and learn about coding, and enjoy hot beverages.  Whether you have decades of coding experience or have just started coding for astronomy, you'll find a supportive environment to enhance your skills.  For all the Code & Cuppa Tutorials [click here](https://github.com/Code-Cuppa/CnC-Tutorials).

### What we do
- **Meet** once a fortnight
- **Bug fixing:** Bring our coding problems to collaboratively solve issues and debug projects
- **Learn new skills:** tutorials by members
- **Drink hot drinks**

### Who can join
Everyone within Astronomy at Durham University is welcome, regardless of skill level.  Bring your favourite hot drink, the bugs you've been struggling with, and join us for a cozy coding session.

### Meeting details
We meet once a fortnight both in-person and on Zoom.  Check the emails and slack for the next session.



## :books: Scraps of Science :telescope:

The place for Astronomers at Durham to show and discuss their current scientific research, and give/receive feedback on others' work. It's an informal meeting where one can bring a recent plot, a curious observations, a useful resource or explain in simple terms their field/technique/theory. All resources generated from the SoS sessions are made available in our [Scrapbook](https://github.com/Code-Cuppa/SoS-Scrapbook) and any plots/observations for which we create a ticket to they may be followed up on are made available on the [GitHub Issues here](https://github.com/Code-Cuppa/SoS-Plot-Tickets/issues).


### What we do
- :calendar: **Meet** once every fortnight (alternating with Code & Cuppa)
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Bring a plot**: Bring along at least one plot from your work which baffles you or that you find interesting, beautiful or that you just want to show off. We will discuss the plot, and (if desired) give feedback. We plan on creating “tickets” for each plot/question, so we can track how a particular “Scrap of Science” is coming along and create a resource for the community. Of course, only if you are comfortable with your plot being shared.
- :telescope: **Bring an observation**:  If you come across an observation of an interesting phenomenon in your field, why not describe in simple terms and show everyone how to 'read' such images.
- :question: **Explain it tome like I'm five**:  If there is wider interest in a new topic, subfield or concept, we can dedicate part of a session to an informal introductory presentation on the subject given by a resident expert. We would aim to make resources and further reading on each topic available after the fact.
- :bookmark: **Mock poster sessions**: If you are soon to present a poster at a conference, why not bring it to SoS in a few minutes to get feedback from the group.
- :stars: **Themed sessions**: If a deadline for certain proposals approaches, if there is a related C&C session or a colloquium happening soon, we may decide to have a particular theme for a session to allow for synergies with other things happening in the field or department.

### Who can join
Everyone within Astronomy at Durham University is welcome, regardless of skill level.

### Meeting details
We meet once a fortnight both in-person and on Zoom. Check the emails and Slack (#sos) for the next session.



## Ground Rules
1. No-one's code is perfect (so don't worry about sharing your imperfect code!)
2. Provide constructive criticism (not just criticism)
3. Don't toolshame (try to provide suggestions using the current tools, not a completely different way of doing things)
4. Bring specific problems (so we don't have to look through 1000 lines of your code)


See you there!
